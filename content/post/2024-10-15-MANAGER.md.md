Hello there! If you're reading this, then I might be your manager! I am
currently cosplaying as a manager at the Wikimedia Foundation. Different people
have different ways of wanting to know how to work (deal) with their manager. My
preferred method is synchronous converation, but many people's preferred style
is reading and async conversations. This document is to help facilite that
conversation and answer some questions you might have.

So, hey! My name is Stef Dunlap (she/they). I am [plural](system.md). I was born
Christmas of '88 in Colorado Springs, lived very briefly in England on an RAF
base, and grew up in Indianapolis. I then moved to Cincinnati, then the San
Francisco Bay Area (Oakland), and then Toronto. I'm poly, trans, queer,
genderfluid, neurodivergent. If you want to know my deal, feel free to read
other posts on [this blog](https://kindrobot.ca).

The way I see it, my job is to support my reports to the best of my ability.
This may look like frequent  1:1s, async check ins, or help as needed. I'm also
here to be a cheat code when navigating the organization, including promotions,
raises, conflicts, bureaucracy, and red tape.

## Communication Style

As I mentioned earlier, my preferred communication style is synchronous
communication, but I also want to be mindful of your time. While there will need
to be regular 1:1s, the frequency and duration of these can be variable. We can
do most of our communication asychronously if you prefer that style.

I'll also admit that I can be very open and personal. I consider very little of
my life private. You are welcome to share however you feel comfortable
(including not at all). You are also welcome to request that I refrain and keep
everything strictly profesh.

## Things we can work on together

I'm here to help and collaborate! Maybe you wanna:
- move up in the organization (read: promotion)
- move laterally in the organization (read: new career path)
- work on a special side project
- work through a difficult conversation/situation
- make changes in the organization

I would be thrilled to help! We can talk about these in our one-on-ones,
schedule a special meeting, or collaborate asynchronously. I'm happy to give as
little or much assistance as you need. This may not be politically correct to
say in a readme: but my first concern is my reports and then second is the
organization. I want to make sure you are content in and (hopefully) excited
about your work.

## On professionalism

I seriously do not care about formalities. I tend to be goofy, because I like to
use humour to bring (remote) teams together. However, we can have serious
conversations when we need to. 

## Paperwork

Unfortunately we do not live in a marxist utopia, and instead in a late-stage capitalism fever dream. Therefore we have to do paperwork about our work. The main one that comes to mind is vaction, time-off, and sick days. Please take your vacations. Make a weekend a long weekend, or take a week or more to do something awesome. All I ask is to have a few days notice for less than a week and more a week's notice if it's a week or more. If it's more than a week, make sure that it's OK with your team as well. If you're sick, you're sick. Do not come to work. Let me know when you can. If you can, send me a message, cancel your meetings, and update your status on the chat app.

I'll also likely ask you to put a little status update in a document every week.
This is not to prove that you did work, but rather to keep a pulse on what's
going on, and help where I can.

## Off-the-record

If you need a conversation that's off the record, you got it. I will stop taking
notes. I will not talk about what we talk about outside of our meeting. I will
not use what you tell me against you. I will however, not be able to forget that
we had the conversation, and I may want to follow up with you, even if it's also
off-the-record.

## Wikimedia Foundation Specific

Wikimedia has a "silent Friday" which I respect. I will almost never schedule a
meeting with you on Friday. You are still welcome to chat with me on the chat
app and schedule a meeting with me if *you* need it. I take Wednesday as a deep
work day. If you schedule something on that day, I may ask that we reschedule it
to another day.

## fin

Oh, uh, here's my cellphone if you ever need it. (I'm also on WhatsApp,
Telegram, and Signal.)
