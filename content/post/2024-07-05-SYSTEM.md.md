Hello, and welcome. If you've been handed this README, then you're someone I
trust. You're someone with whom I want to share the whole "me," or rather
should I say, "the whole 'us.'" You see, I (we) am (are) plural, a system, a
collection of multiple persons in the same body, three sloths in a trench coat.
(That last one's a joke.)

## Don't Panic

Oh boy, this just got a bit awkward, eh? Let us, uh, show you a picture
of our late hamster, Estelle.

Okay, hopefully we're all feeling a bit better. Let's resume. <3

## Our experience

This is all still very new to us. What we can say is that much of our life has
been marked by internal forces working at cross-paths with each other.
Realizing and coming out to ourselves was a spiritual experience where
all-of-a-sudden these energies, these people, could talk to one another and
cooperate. This made us feel the most comfortable in our body and our brain
than ever before.

## Us

We are, to the best of our knowledge, three entities in a closed system.
Collectively we answer to Stef (she/they). We do our best to be honest with one
another, be kind to one another, and cooperate towards achieving our common
goal: namely to be a kind human and leave the world a little better and a
little weirder than we found it. Our names were picked out of a bag of names we
have either used or considered using for our vessel. There isn't anything
particularly meaningful about them.

### Stef (she/they) 👩‍💼

Stef fronts most of the time these days. Since its her name on the vessel right
now, she feels an extra sense of responsibility for keeping everything in
order. When she's not on the beam, she can be a bit controlling. She is
curious, sincere, and pragmatic. Her goal is to someday be a mother and a wife.

### Stephanie (she/her) 💃

Stephanie is a younger (adult) spirit. She's silly, flirty, very outgoing,
sarcastic. She can be a blind optimist. Her ultimate goal is to do humanitarian
work.

### Tom (they/he) 🧑‍💻

Tom is an older spirit, who fronted most of the time until late 2021, when he
consciously handed the reigns over to Stef. Tom is very smart, a bit of an
absentminded professor type. Tom abruptly starts fronting when they see an
injustice being carried, a person in danger, or sense that the system is in
danger. Tom's goal is to get out of the house and teach somebody something
fascinating.

## Conclusion

This page will be a work in progress for some time. Please feel free to ask
questions. Here are a few I anticipate:

* Should I address you any differently?
  * Probably not, we all will answer to Stef (she/they), and will let you know
    in the moment if we prefer something else.
  * If you want to address the system as a whole, you can use "y'all."
* Is it rude to ask to whom I'm speaking?
  * No, in fact it makes us feel seen and cared for.
